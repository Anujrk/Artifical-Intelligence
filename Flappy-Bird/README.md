# Artifical-Intelligence
The following game(Flappy-bird) is played by an AI using genetic algorithm, where a set of players(50) play the game during initital stage i.e Generation 0 and the best among them are saved and genetically mutated and names as Generation 1.
Genetic Algorithm : A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that is inspired by Charles Darwin's theory of natural evolution. This algorithm reflects the process of natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction in order to produce offspring of the next generation.
The Generation with highest success rate is taken into account and considers to be winner. The highly mutated offsprings can beat the game and its almost impossible to lose.
The following program uses python along with pygame to achieve the layout of the game.
For neural network programming neat-python module is used which creates the necessary environment and conditions for the AI player.
