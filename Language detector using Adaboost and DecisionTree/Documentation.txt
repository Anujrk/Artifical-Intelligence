1. Main file :  Main.py

2. Input to the program : 
	For Training  --- 'Syntax :train <examples> <hypothesisOut> <learning-type>'
	
	For Testing   --- 'Syntax :predict <hypothesis> <file> <testing-type(dt or ada)>'

Train.dat contains the training sentences with 15 words
Test.dat contains the testing sentences with 15 words

HypothesisOut is the trained model created using training file i.e train.dat

3. Example of input

	For Training of decisionTree = train train.dat dt-hypothesis dt
	For testing with decisionTree = predict dt-hypothesis test.dat dt

The same is applied while training and resting for Adaboost where dt is replaced with ada.
